# Phase 1: Design & Key Management âœ… COMPLETE

## Overview
Define folderâ†’device sync policy schema (TOML/JSON) and integrate Keychain with RSA/ECDSA keypairs in Rust library.

## Status: COMPLETED ðŸŽ‰

All Phase 1 tasks have been successfully implemented. See [PHASE1-COMPLETE.md](../PHASE1-COMPLETE.md) for detailed implementation summary.

## Tasks

### Policy Schema Design
- [x] Define TOML configuration schema for sync policies
- [x] Create JSON schema alternative for programmatic use
- [x] Document all configuration options
- [x] Add validation rules for configurations
- [x] Create example configurations for common use cases

### Key Management Infrastructure
- [x] Research macOS Keychain Services API
- [x] Design key storage architecture
- [x] Implement Rust wrapper for Keychain Services
- [x] Support RSA-2048/4096 key generation
- [x] Support ECDSA P-256/P-384 key generation
- [x] Implement key rotation mechanism
- [x] Create key backup/export functionality

### Security Architecture
- [x] Define threat model document
- [x] Design encryption scheme (AES-256-GCM)
- [x] Implement secure key derivation (PBKDF2/Argon2)
- [x] Design key lifecycle management
- [x] Create security audit checklist

### Integration & Testing
- [x] Unit tests for key generation
- [x] Integration tests with Keychain
- [x] Performance benchmarks for crypto operations
- [x] Security review of implementation

## Deliverables
1. Configuration schema documentation
2. Rust Keychain wrapper library
3. Security architecture document
4. Test suite for key management

## Success Criteria
- All keys stored securely in macOS Keychain
- Configuration schema validated and documented
- Crypto operations pass security audit
- Performance meets requirements (<100ms for key operations)
